# K&R Exercise 1.1

Solution to Exercise 1.1 from Kernighan and Ritchie (1988).

## Instruction

Compile and run a minimal "Hello world!" program written in C. After the program
successfully runs, intentionally introduce errors and observe the resulting
compiler diagnostics.

## Solution

There is an example program in the book but I implemented my own version of the program, using a slightly more modern style than the example shown in the book.
